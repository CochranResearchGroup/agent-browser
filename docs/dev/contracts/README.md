# API Contracts

This directory holds machine-readable schemas for service API records that
software clients and MCP agents are expected to consume directly.

## Service Job Record v1

`service-job-record.v1.schema.json` describes service job records returned by:

- HTTP `GET /api/service/jobs`
- HTTP `GET /api/service/jobs/<id>`
- MCP `agent-browser://jobs`
- service trace job arrays

The schema is guarded by Rust tests for the model, HTTP, and MCP surfaces. Keep
new contractual job fields in this schema before relying on them from external
clients.

## Service Incident Record v1

`service-incident-record.v1.schema.json` describes grouped service incident
records returned by:

- HTTP `GET /api/service/incidents`
- HTTP `GET /api/service/incidents/<id>`
- MCP `agent-browser://incidents`
- MCP `service_incidents`
- service trace incident arrays

The schema is guarded by Rust tests for the model, HTTP, MCP, and service trace
surfaces. Keep new contractual incident fields in this schema before relying on
them from external clients.

## Service Event Record v1

`service-event-record.v1.schema.json` describes retained service event records
returned by:

- HTTP `GET /api/service/events`
- MCP `agent-browser://events`
- service trace event arrays

The schema is guarded by Rust tests for the model, HTTP, MCP, and service trace
surfaces. Keep new contractual event fields in this schema before relying on
them from external clients.
