## Turn 372 | 2026-09-16

[Plan 0209](docs/dev/plans/0209-2026-09-16-visual-provider-protocol.md)
admits W7-B locally on `challenge/p209-visual-provider-protocol` from published
P206 head `5da7d37d`. The packet freezes only the pure provider request and
response protocol, exact evidence and capability binding, candidate-only output
and typed abstention. It may use fake serialized fixtures but no model, image,
browser, CAPTCHA, desktop input, credential, runtime or production effect.
Publication and CI are held until issue #174 lands through merged PR #179.

## Turn 371 | 2026-09-16

[Plan 0206](docs/dev/plans/0206-2026-09-16-visual-multi-round-challenge-contract.md)
is source-complete and acceptance-complete at `ac9f50a7` on
`challenge/p206-visual-round-contract`,
based on exact published P197 head `cd22a39f`. The pure challenge-control
contract keeps visual rounds inside one attempt, binds each selection and
effect receipt to fresh evidence and exact candidate identities, preserves
after-state continuity, and enforces per-round plus cumulative budgets. All 39
crate tests, including the complete 23-case visual-round matrix, the crate
architecture guard, formatting, strict workspace Clippy and diff hygiene pass.
P197 head `cd22a39f` passed all ordinary required checks and merged through PR
#157 as `c855fc33`. P206 joined that canonical checkpoint at tree-preserving
merge `5d6e3d57`; only exact-head forge evaluation and protected P206
integration remain. No browser, model provider, CAPTCHA, desktop input,
credential, installed runtime, production or CI-policy effect occurred.

## Turn 370 | 2026-09-16

[Plan 0197](docs/dev/plans/0197-2026-09-16-challenge-consumer-integration.md)
joins canonical `main@2632e31c` after P202 protected integration and closeout.
The source merge is clean outside this runbook projection, retains the complete
P197 consumer-admission implementation and combined provider-free validation,
and removes P202 as an active dependency. Final plan and lane reconciliation,
branch publication at `4321961c` is complete; exact-head forge evaluation and
protected P197 integration remain. P197 now has durable remote custody and its
clean primary checkout can be released. W7-A is selected as the next
provider-free challenge packet but is not yet admitted. No browser, CAPTCHA,
provider, credential, installed-runtime, Service State, production, release, or
CI-policy effect occurred.

## Turn 369 | 2026-09-16

[Plan 0202](docs/dev/plans/0202-2026-09-16-abandoned-service-browser-retirement.md)
is closed. [PR #168](https://github.com/CochranResearchGroup/agent-browser/pull/168)
merged source head `6f099292` into `main` as `528f2ef0`; issue #103 closed.
Provider-free qualification and the isolated disposable real-browser acceptance
passed. CI run `35163527521` passed every ordinary gate at reviewed code head
`d7ceca98`; the final head added only integrated P203 closeout documentation,
and its in-flight Rust rerun was cancelled after the PR merged. P202 is removed
from the active-lane catalog and releases its shared surfaces to P197. No
browser, provider, credential, profile, installed-runtime, Service State,
production, or release effect occurred during integration or closeout.
